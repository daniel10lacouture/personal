# Snowflake SQL Query Optimizer Application ❄️

Dealing with slow-running SQL queries can be frustrating and costly. After years of working in the data space, I’ve seen how inefficient queries can sap both compute credits and productivity. That’s why I’ve put together a Streamlit application that leverages Snowflake Cortex to streamline this process. Here are three key benefits you can expect:

- **Save on Compute Credits**: Efficiently optimized queries mean less compute time and lower costs.
- **Boost Performance**: Faster query execution times will enhance your overall data processing and analysis speed.
- **Simplify Optimization**: Let Snowflake Cortex handle the heavy lifting of query optimization, so you can focus on what matters most. Simply copy, paste, and run.
