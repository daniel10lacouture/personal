# Personal Projects by Daniel Lacouture üöÄ

Welcome to my public repository where I share various personal projects that I work on. This space is dedicated to exploring and utilizing cutting-edge technologies on Snowflake like Streamlit and Snowflake Container Services to create innovative solutions. Here, you‚Äôll find applications and tools designed to help clients maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of their Snowflake investment.

## Featured Project: Getting Started with Streamlit in Snowflake (SiS) ‚ùÑÔ∏è

### Snowflake SQL Optimizer Application

Dealing with slow-running SQL queries can be frustrating and costly. After years of working in the data space, I‚Äôve seen how inefficient queries can sap both compute credits and productivity. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve put together a Streamlit application that leverages Snowflake Cortex to streamline this process. Here are three key benefits you can expect:

- **Save on Compute Credits**: Efficiently optimized queries mean less compute time and lower costs.
- **Boost Performance**: Faster query execution times will enhance your overall data processing and analysis speed.
- **Simplify Optimization**: Let Snowflake Cortex handle the heavy lifting of query optimization, so you can focus on what matters most. Simply copy, paste, and run.

## Explore More

Feel free to explore the projects, try them out, and provide feedback. Whether you‚Äôre looking to improve your data processing performance, cut costs, or simply explore new ways to utilize Snowflake, there‚Äôs something here for you.

### Topics Covered:
- **Snowflake**: Harness the power of Snowflake for your data warehousing needs.
- **Streamlit**: Build interactive, real-time data applications with ease.
- **Snowflake Container Services**: Explore the integration of container services with Snowflake for scalable solutions.
